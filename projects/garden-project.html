            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> Mr. Mueller assigned the class a movie webpage project to do with your table partner. He assigned this project to put our skills of HTML and CSS to the test along with our creativity. The movie website we made was a project referenced off of Darling In the Franxx that I made with my partner. Mr. Mueller gave the class the option to choose any topic we wanted, so we chose Darling In the Franxx as a reference to our webpage.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>On our movie webpage, me and my partner needed to follow the requirements needed in order to get a full score on the assignment. We needed both CSS and HTML in our webpage along with planning, so the requirements were a planning page, for html it was headers, paragraphs, divs and spans, google fonts that haven't been used in class, and inputs and submits. For css it was design that would make the webpage look amazing, which included selectors and box models, which were element, class, id, padding, border, and margin. The webpage also needed original images or images that are not copyrighted. If we wanted extra credit, which we did, we had to create a sequel for the project. </p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The problem that me and my partner had were the spans for text designs in order for the dialouges and names to look cool. First, we only tried a single span in for certain parts of our text, but we couldn't figure out how to make multiple colors. In which case, me and my partner searched up ways to put multiple spans, so we went to W3Schools to see how to make multiple spans. As a result, we replaced just the span with multiple spans by setting the spans as classes, making it into `.first-span` and `.second.span`</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Something major that I learned from this project was to divide roles in order to get maximum efficiency when working with someone along with communicating properly. The worst mistake to do is when the weekend comes, you have no contact with your partner and you have to do the project by yourself. But with the correct communication, me and my partner were able to finish the movie webpage with little to no issue because we communicated correctly and divided roles correctly. He worked on most of the CSS whilst I worked on the HTML. Overall, I was able to learn the integral factors of communication and task seperation.</p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>I plan on improving my skills in both CSS and HTML in order to make future projects better as I think that for my first project, it was a little lackluster due to my creativity and my limited skills in CSS. Although the project was a bit lacking, I'm really proud of myself that I actually made a webpage with the help of my partner. It was really fun aswell, being able to work on something that I enjoy.</p>
